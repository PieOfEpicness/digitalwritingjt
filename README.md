## Week one reflection 
(3/3/25)
<p>My brain did an insomnia and I wasn't able to sleep more than an hour or two before class. I am very tired and can only hope that everything went in. Also I forgot my ADHD meds. I am looking forward to learning everything I can in this class, as vague and generic as that sounds. I need some sleep.</p>

(5/3/25)
<p>Finally got some well needed sleep, and I didn't forget my ADHD meds! I was able to pay more attention in class with less effort, and could think my train of thought without accidentally totally forgetting to listen to what was being said around me. I'm really looking forward to learning how to do some basic coding, and figuring out what I want to do for the first and second/third assessments. There's still some questions and clariications I need so I know what I can and can't do. Can't make an adaptation of a work (House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski), but I can definitely take inspiration from it. We can't work with an artist if we want some original artwork, but I assume we can use stock art/imagry? Also, loved the conversations we had about what is considered e-literature and digital writing, where's the line between interactive fiction and games.</p>

## Week three reflection
(17/3/25)

How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
<p>I'm definitely gaining confidence as I'm learning. This is a whole new language, and my brain is more receptive to that type of learning as I've been learning Finnish for the past nearly two years. There's some plasticity there, and that is helping in the ase of learning coding. I'm looking forward to seeing these skills grow and improve over time.</p>

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
<p>I am definitely seeing more possibilities, especially with how a work looks, not just how it reads. Being a screenwriter, I'm used to working with a team to create a vision, but for something like this, I'm by myself. I don't consider myself to have much in the way of artistic skills, but coding at least offers a portal into which I can more easily transfer the image I have in my head onto a screen.</p>

What aspects of the remix are the same?
<p> I really liked the locations, so I kept those.</p>
What aspects of the remix are different?
<p></p>
Is the remix successful (why or why not)?


## Week five reflection
(2/4/25)

What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3?
The concept and story is already flowing pretty freely in my head, and I look forward to writing it all down. I can already see how it looks in my head, how someone will read it, navigate it, experience it.

What platform and technology does it require?
I think it'll just use basic html, there'll be nothing fancy, just how paragraphs are shaped.

Do you know already if you can make it?
I certainly believe in myself that I can make it.

What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?
More html!!!
