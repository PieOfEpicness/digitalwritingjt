## Week one reflection 
(3/3/25)
<p>My brain did an insomnia and I wasn't able to sleep more than an hour or two before class. I am very tired and can only hope that everything went in. Also I forgot my ADHD meds. I am looking forward to learning everything I can in this class, as vague and generic as that sounds. I need some sleep.</p>

(5/3/25)
Finally got some well needed sleep, and I didn't forget my ADHD meds! I was able to pay more attention in class with less effort, and could think my train of thought without accidentally totally forgetting to listen to what was being said around me. I'm really looking forward to learning how to do some basic coding, and figuring out what I want to do for the first and second/third assessments. There's still some questions and clariications I need so I know what I can and can't do. Can't make an adaptation of a work (House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski), but I can definitely take inspiration from it. We can't work with an artist if we want some original artwork, but I assume we can use stock art/imagry? Also, loved the conversations we had about what is considered e-literature and digital writing, where's the line between interactive fiction and games.
